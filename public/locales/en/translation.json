    "text": "When collateralizing DOWS synthetic assets, a \"debt\" is generated. The \"debt\" is the amount of xUSD they initially minted. Next, the debt will fluctuate with the gains and losses of other synthetic asset holders. When the synthetic assets held by someone increase in value, that part of the proceeds will come from the debts of all DOWS holders in proportion. Each holder must pay their debts to unlock their collateralized DOWS."
